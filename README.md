## Summary

The website based in this repository has been created in memory of all the deceased in the Bologna Massacre. This project has been defined in the context of the course [Knowledge Organization and Digital Methods in the Cultural Heritage Domain](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2019/424639) held by Francesca Tomasi within the master degree course [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) at the University of Bologna.

On August 2, 1980, at 10.25 a.m., a bomb exploded in the second-class room of the Bologna railway station. The explosion hit the train standing at platform one and the tunnel under the track broughting down the southwest wing of the station. This tragic event caused 85 deaths and more than 200 injuries.

The perspective with which this work has been done is that of Linked Open Data (LOD). 10 cultural objects (books, movies etc.) describing that event have been taken into consideration. Their metadata have been extracted, analysed, described following specific metadata standards, connected among each other and serialised in RDF. The teps followed are described and documented in the website.
